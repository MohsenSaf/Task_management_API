Certainly! After reviewing your project at https://github.com/MohsenSaf/Task_management_API.git, I've prepared an enhanced README to provide clearer guidance and comprehensive information for users and contributors.

Task Management API
Description
The Task Management API is a robust backend service that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. Key functionalities include:
    • User Capabilities:
        ◦ Create: Add new tasks with attributes such as title, description, status, due date, and priority. 
        ◦ Read: View their own tasks or a list of all their tasks. 
        ◦ Update: Modify existing tasks. 
        ◦ Delete: Remove tasks they own. 
    • Admin Capabilities:
        ◦ Access and manage all tasks within the system. 
This API is built with a modern tech stack to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance.

Tech Stack
    • Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment. 
    • Express: Web framework for building the API. 
    • Prisma: ORM for database interactions. 
    • TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript adding static types. 
    • Redis: In-memory data structure store, used for caching. 
    • Zod: TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. 
    • MySQL: Relational database management system. 
    • MongoDB: NoSQL database for flexible data storage. 

Features
    • User Authentication: Secure login system for users and admins. 
    • Task Management: 
        ◦ Create, read, update, and delete tasks. 
        ◦ Assign priorities and due dates to tasks. 
    • Admin Controls: Comprehensive access to all tasks for administrative purposes. 
    • Data Validation: Ensured by Zod schemas. 
    • Caching: Implemented with Redis for optimized performance. 

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
    • Node.js (v14.x or later) 
    • npm (v6.x or later) 
    • TypeScript (v4.x or later) 
    • MySQL server 
    • MongoDB server 
    • Redis server 
Installation Steps
    1. Clone the Repository:
       git clone https://github.com/MohsenSaf/Task_management_API.git
       cd Task_management_API
    2. Install Dependencies:
       npm install
    3. Compile TypeScript:
       npx tsc

Environment Variables
Configure the application by creating a .env file in the root directory. Refer to .env.example for the required variables:
    • DATABASE_URL: Connection string for MySQL. 
    • MONGODB_URI: Connection string for MongoDB. 
    • REDIS_HOST: Hostname for Redis. 
    • REDIS_PORT: Port for Redis. 
    • JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JSON Web Token authentication. 
    • PORT: Port number on which the server will run. 
Ensure all variables are set appropriately before running the application.

Database Migrations
After setting up your environment variables and databases:
    1. Run Prisma Migrations:
       npx prisma migrate deploy
    2. Generate Prisma Client:
       npx prisma generate

Running the Application
Start the server using:
npm start
By default, the API will be accessible at http://localhost:3000. You can change the port by setting the PORT environment variable.

API Endpoints
Authentication
    • POST /auth/register: Register a new user. 
    • POST /auth/login: Authenticate a user and retrieve a token. 
    • GET/auth/getToken:Get access token
    • GET/auth/logout:Logout user
Tasks
    • POST /tasks: Create a new task. 
    • GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks for the authenticated user. 
    • GET /tasks/:id: Retrieve a specific task by ID. 
    • PUT /tasks/:id: Update a task by ID. 
    • DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task by ID. 
Admin
    • GET /admin/tasks: Retrieve all tasks (admin only). 
    • GET /admin/tasks/:id: Retrieve a specific task by ID (admin only). 
    • PUT /admin/tasks/:id: Update a task by ID (admin only). 
    • DELETE /admin/tasks/:id: Delete any task by ID (admin only). 
Note: All task-related endpoints require authentication via a valid JWT token.
